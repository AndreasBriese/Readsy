/etc/launchd.conf has never existed by default, but it does still work in 10.9.

Run for example sudo nano /etc/launchd.conf.
Add a line like setenv JAVA_HOME /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home. (I don't know what JAVA_HOME should actually be set to though.)
Either restart or run launchctl < /etc/launchd.conf; sudo launchctl < /etc/launchd.conf and relaunch processes.
launchctl export prints variables exported by the user launchd process and sudo launchctl export prints variables exported by the root launchd process.

This method can also be used to set a default path. For example I have added this line to /etc/launchd.conf:

setenv PATH /Users/lauri/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/libexec:/usr/texbin

(I used /Users/lauri/bin instead of ~/bin because ~/bin would be /var/root/bin for programs run as root.)

pg_resetxlog: lock file "/usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid" exists
Is a server running?  If not, delete the lock file and try again.
$ rm /usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid
$ pg_resetxlog /usr/local/var/postgres
The database server was not shut down cleanly.
Resetting the transaction log might cause data to be lost.
If you want to proceed anyway, use -f to force reset.
$ pg_resetxlog -f /usr/local/var/postgres
Transaction log reset

$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
